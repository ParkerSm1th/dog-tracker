# Dog Tracker
This app is still heavily a WIP but the goals are:
[ ] Use NestJS to create a CRUD API that can accompany the app and send notifications
[ ] Allow users to create pets
[ ] Allow users to share access to pets
[ ] Allow users to create routines and intervals for them
[ ] Allow users to store important info about their pets
[ ] Allow users to easily customize pet profiles
